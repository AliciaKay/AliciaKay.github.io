            <strong>
              <em>Problem:</em>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>As a Bullet Journal enthusiast, I was unable to keep up with the hobby while attending Prime. It takes time to
            set up and maintain, which I did not have as a student.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <em>Solution:</em>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>I created a visually pleasing web application to take care of the basic organization of my tasks, the way a handwritten
            Bullet Journal normally would. Users can add events, notes, and tasks, and track the time taken to complete their
            tasks using a Pomodoro timer.</p>

          <li class="center-list"><strong>The Show</strong></li>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <em>Problem:</em>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>The Annual AdFedMN awards show, The Show, has a current website to display the ad agencies who have been awarded
            Gold, Silver or Bronze awards by a judging panel. The website was functional but minimally user-friendly. It
            was relatively static, and the process for uploading the annual data was time consuming for our client. Ad Agencies
            were unable to post any contact information for their organizations.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <em>Solution:</em>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>Our group was able to streamline the process for uploading the data for the site using a CSV upload for the site
            admin, develop a process for inviting ad agency users to create and edit profiles which automatically populate
            the awards they have won, and we were able to display the annual winners in a more interactive interface.</p>

        <p>April 2016-July 2017</p>
        <p>
          <u>Primary Responsibilities:</u>
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Maintain quality systems documentation for all field personnel (as many as 30+ active jobs).</li>
          <li>Develop solutions using VBA in Word and Excel for over 240 electronic forms within a Laserfiche repository.</li>
          <li>Main point-of-contact for all project-specific documentation-change needs.</li>
          <li>Maintain Quality Systems documentation within the Blattner Intranet.</li>
          <li>Report generation and distribution, typical administrative assistant duties (meeting coordination, written communication
            in all forms, general "customer" service).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Skills Gained/Special Projects:</h4>
        <div id="projects">
          <ol>
            <li>Self-taught Visual Basic for Applications using internet resources such as Stack Overflow, as well as utilization
              of good old-fashioned books.</li>
            <li>My visual basic skills were put to the test while converting over 240 paper-based documents to e-forms that could
              be filled out on a tablet in MS Word or Excel. One issue I had to solve was as follows;


              <p>
                <strong>
                  <em>Problem:</em>
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>Forms are password protected to ensure version control, but we wanted to be able to have the user add a page
                specifically for photos, without having to know the password to unlock the document.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  <em>Solution:</em>
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>I was able to achieve this by creating and saving a template of the desired photo page to each user's C: Drive.
              </p>
              <p>In the form, when the user clicked the command button, Word would:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>open the template document,</li>
                <li>copy its contents,</li>
                <li>unlock the form,</li>
                <li>paste the photo page to the location specified within the document,</li>
                <li>close the template, and</li>
                <li>re-lock the form with the password.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                <strong>A brief screen video of the photo page button in action, as well as a Reset button I developed to erase a
                  signature from an InkPicture control:</strong>
